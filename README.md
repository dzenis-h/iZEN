## About 📝

iZEN is a solid and simple meditation app that helps you relax and focus. It's still in a major development, but it's fully functional and useful. It also contains a HTML route (page) to a nice [how-to guide](https://dzenis-h.github.io/iZEN/about/about.html) for meditation. Inside of this app, there's also a [Breather app](https://dzenis-h.github.io/iZEN/BreatherApp/index.html) that I personally use for my breathing relaxation therapy.

> ## iZEN 🙏

>#### Motivation:
>I was looking for a solid and simple meditation app. I've looked around, got bored and then inspired so I created iZEN. -It's a app that's still in a major development, still fully functional and kinda useful and in addition to that it also contains a `HTML` route (page) to a nice meditation how-to guide. 

>#### Instructions:
>After cloning it, use something like a `LiveServer` to start the `index.html` correctly :)
